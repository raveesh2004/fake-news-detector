# Fake News Detector :

## Data Analysis
- It is the process of systematically applying statistical and/or logical techniques such as cleaning, transforming, and modeling data to discover useful information for business decision-making. 

## Dataset used 
[https://github.com/raveesh2004/fake-news-detector/blob/main/True%20news%20dataset.zip
](url)

## Important instructions
- **python version should be *latest***

## Technologies used :
### Language 
- *Python*- for programming and writing logic.
  
### Python libraries 
-   matplotlib, numpy, pandas,scikit_learn,seaborn,re,string.
### Algorithms 
- Machine Learning Algorithms such as Logistic Regression ,Random Forest Classifier ,Decision Tree Classifier and Gradient Boosting Classifier.

## Working of the app :
### Import libraries and dataset.
- First of all,import all the required modules and libraries of python.
- Then, the csv file is loaded to obtain dataset.
- We combined our datasets of true and fake and we removed all the Null vaules.
- Then we preprocessed the dataset.
- Then different machine learning algorithms were applied .

### Adding functionality : 1- feature
> - **NumPy**- *It is  a Python package used for performing the various numerical computations and processing of the multidimensional and single-dimensional array elements.*
> - **Pandas**- *It is an open source Python package that is used for data science/data analysis and machine learning tasks.*

### 2- feature
- These models are imported from sklearn library of Python.
> - **Sklearn**- *The sklearn library contains a lot of efficient tools for machine learning and statistical modeling including classification, regression, clustering and dimensionality reduction.*
> - **TfidfVectorizer**- *is a feature extraction tool that transforms text documents into numerical representations based on term frequency-inverse document frequency.*

### 3- feature
> **Logistic Regression** -*is a machine learning algorithm used for binary classification tasks, estimating the probability of a sample belonging to a particular class.*
> **Decision Tree Classifier** -*is a machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks, where it builds a decision tree to predict the class label of a sample based on its features.*
> **Gradient Boosting Classifier** -*is a machine learning algorithm that builds an ensemble of decision trees sequentially, where each subsequent tree corrects the errors made by the previous ones, ultimately improving predictive accuracy.*
> **Random Forest Classifier ** -* is a machine learning algorithm that builds an ensemble of decision trees and combines their predictions to make a final classification, resulting in improved accuracy and robustness compared to individual trees.*

## Functionality & features :
### 1. Visual Representation :
- You can visually represent the different features of cars such as engine size, length, width, horsepower, etc in the form of various *charts and graphs* such as bar, line, area, scatter, pie, donut chart. The charts and graphs are **interactive**; you can choose or select one or more features, and also the type of graphs.








## Application of Fake News Detection 
- In automobile industry, analyzed data is used to improve the customer experience, where data grouping and segmentation can lead to more *effective marketing and improved customer engagement , more targeted one‑to‑one offers* and can help the automobile industry to correctly manage the features and price of cars. 
-The analyzed data can be used for changing the **auto business, support mechanization, and boost automation.**
