## Important instructions
- **python version should be *latest***

## Technologies used :
### Language 
- *Python*- for programming and writing logic.
  
### Python libraries 
-   matplotlib, numpy, pandas,scikit_learn,seaborn,re,string.
### Algorithms 
- Machine Learning Algorithms such as Logistic Regression ,Random Forest Classifier ,Decision Tree Classifier and Gradient Boosting Classifier.

## Working of the app :
### Import libraries and dataset.
- First of all,import all the required modules and libraries of python.
- Then, the csv file is loaded to obtain dataset.
- We combined our datasets of true and fake and we removed all the Null vaules.
- Then we preprocessed the dataset.
- Then different machine learning algorithms were applied .

### Adding functionality : 1- feature
> - **NumPy**- *It is  a Python package used for performing the various numerical computations and processing of the multidimensional and single-dimensional array elements.*
> - **Pandas**- *It is an open source Python package that is used for data science/data analysis and machine learning tasks.*

### 2- feature
- These models are imported from sklearn library of Python.
> - **Sklearn**- *The sklearn library contains a lot of efficient tools for machine learning and statistical modeling including classification, regression, clustering and dimensionality reduction.*
> - **TfidfVectorizer**- *is a feature extraction tool that transforms text documents into numerical representations based on term frequency-inverse document frequency.*

### 3- feature
> - **Logistic Regression** -*is a machine learning algorithm used for binary classification tasks, estimating the probability of a sample belonging to a particular class.*
> - **Decision Tree Classifier** -*is a machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks, where it builds a decision tree to predict the class label of a sample based on its features.*
> - **Gradient Boosting Classifier** -*is a machine learning algorithm that builds an ensemble of decision trees sequentially, where each subsequent tree corrects the errors made by the previous ones, ultimately improving predictive accuracy.*
> - **Random Forest Classifier** -*is a machine learning algorithm that builds an ensemble of decision trees and combines their predictions to make a final classification, resulting in improved accuracy and robustness compared to individual trees.*

## Application of Fake News Detection 
- Fake news detection technology can be integrated into educational programs to teach individuals critical thinking skills and how to evaluate the credibility of news sources.
- Fake news detection algorithms can be implemented by social media platforms and online news aggregators to automatically identify and flag potentially false or misleading content. This helps prevent the rapid spread of misinformation through viral sharing.
- Journalists and fact-checking organizations can utilize fake news detection tools to verify the accuracy of information before publishing news stories. Automated systems assist in identifying dubious claims or sources, ensuring reliable information dissemination.
